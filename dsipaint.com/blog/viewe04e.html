						It was a new day, the sun was shining just through the clouds, it had rained the night before, and no school for the whole week. "Joshua come down, breakfast is ready." yelled Mrs.Relic "Yes ma'am." said young Joshua Relic as he rushed downstairs "Are you excited to see Leah today?" asked his mom "Yeah, I haven't seen her all year, we're gonna have so much fun!" said Joshua in a squeaky voice "Well make sure to wash up, we're having dinner at a fancy restaurant tonight." said his mom "Yaaa, I'll be as good as possible!" said Joshua as he stuffed the rest of his food in his mouth and ran to change his clothes. <br /><br />Near lunchtime a truck pulled up, Joshua was waiting outside, then his best friend Leah Kade rushed out gave him a big hug. "I missed you Josh!" the girl said almost stuttering "I missed you too Leah!" said Josh happily "Alright you two have fun." said Mr.Kade while Mrs.Kade stumbled in the house drunkenly "What do you wanna do?" asked Leah "We can play on the swing set."  said Josh "Yeah, lets do that!" Leah yelled in excitement, so the played all day until dusk. "I'm tired, what should we do?" said Leah almost falling over "We can talk by the fence." said Josh, so they talked about the little bugs on the grass and the birds in the sky until they were called inside. <br /><br />As they were going inside Mrs.Kade stormed out and grabbed Leah by the arm "Mom where are we going?" said Leah confused "We are leaving!" shouted Mrs.Kade, then they drove off. "Mom, why did they go?" said Josh sad "They have to go somewhere." said his mom annoyed, then Josh began to cry "What's wrong honey? said his mom "I-I just wanted talk to Leah." muttered Josh "It's ok, you will get to talk to her soon." Mrs.Relic assured him. <br /><br />Josh waited until the days became years, when he was 13 they moved to an apartment away from his old house and on his 15 birthday a visitor came, "Honey, I have someone for you to see." said his mom "Is it another teacher?" asked Josh less than enthusiastic "Hi Josh." said a familiar voice "What, Leah!" said Josh shocked "Yes it's me, you look nice." said Leah "You look more beautiful than ever!" Josh said as he hugged Leah "Ow, be carefull!" said Leah, holding her side "Oh sorry, I just missed you so much." apologized Josh "I missed you too, I just hurt my side recently." said Leah as she sat in a chair, so Leah and Josh talked all night long in the room until midnight "I'm kind of tired Josh, I got to go mom might yell at me again." said Leah "You can stay with me, I won't let her yell at you tonight." smiled Josh "I guess I'll stay the night." smirked Leah "You see that big building over there?" said Josh "Yeah, what about it?" asked Leah "I'm gonna save enough money, and live there with you." said Josh "Aw thanks Josh." said Leah as she held him close. <br /><br />The next day Mrs.Kade was yelling all through the house, blaming everyone for her problems, so Josh told Leah to wait in the room while he got them some food, "You and your dumb kid can't get anything right Tanya!" yelled Mrs.Kade "You shouldn't be yelling, it's still 6:30." said Mrs.Relic, as they both yelled at each other and Mr.Kade worked on his paperwork Josh grabbed some breakfast food and ran back to the room. But when he opened the door he saw Leah on the floor...with a knife in her chest and a note, "N-no, Le-Leah...I can't...no." muttered Josh as he fell to his knees and grabbed the note, it read "I'm sorry Josh I just can't burden my family anymore, so I will put an end to my life to help them out. Goodbye and I love you", a tear began to fall from Joshes eye and then he called for help.<br /><br />The next day, at the funeral, everyone was silent except Mrs.Kade. "It's all your fault you dumb useless kid!" screemed Mrs.Kade, but Josh just looked at the coffin of his best friend and started to cry. As the years past he grew up and his mother past away, but only him and Mr.Kade attended the funeral, then Mr.Kade told him to walk with him "Kid your mom was like the sister I always wanted, I thank you for putting up with me all those years." said Kade, but Josh was silent, and then they stopped at Leahs grave and Josh fell to his hands and knees "I'm sorry Leah, I wish I was there for you that day, goodbye my best friend!." Josh said as he wept then Mr.Kade put down some flowers and slipped Josh a card. <br /><br />				</div>
