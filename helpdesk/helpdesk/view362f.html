			SO this sounds extremely tedious, but I would love to see a reconstruction of the private messaging system.<br /><br />Of course, it's a lot and this can be disregarded since I know certain devices may not be able to handle it, BUT if it can be done, I'd love for Hull to take it into consideration.<br /><br />I put stars and red text at the suggestions that really really should be used to make PMing more neat and easy.<br /><br />So what I'm thinking is a system that is basically like Discord (in a way?), but without all of the little extra complicated stuff.<br /><br /><span style="color:red">â˜…First of all, to have the messages organized by member, instead of every single one all jammed into a messy list... because to be honest, it's a lot and always a hassle to find a particular message or delete it. And then organize that in a list with the member's name and their profile picture, as well as maybe an indicator if the member is online.</span><br /><br /><span style="color:red">â˜…Another thing is to have all messages read down to up, just to make it easier to read, as well as the typing bar text box thingie on the bottom, like the chatroom.</span><br /><br />I also think it would be kinda cool to have a lil thing to show if the member is typing or not, but that probably isn't possible so ignore it. Just a thought.<br /><br /><span style="color:red">â˜…If we could get a selection option to select message threads and delete them, that would be great.</span><br /><br />Another thing is possibly group chats. I know that you can compose messages to be sent to multiple recipients, but it's sent separately. For what reason, I don't know.<br /><br />Basically, the system I have in mind is like Discord, Instagram, Twitter, SnapChat, Hangouts... a lot of social media or chatting apps/sites.<br /><br />Like I said, all of this is highly unlikely to pull... BUT if we can at least fix it to some of the aforementioned suggestions, that would make the PM system a lot cleaner and easier to manage.		</div>

			The design was to be threads, not messages, my apologies.<br /><br />I'm just trying to rationalize how that'd look: so a "reply" thing that once you click, pops out two textareas and a send button like how the messages are currently.<br /><br />Also, did I get every other aspect right?		</div>

			1. I partially disagree then, I like having separate threads, but it wouldn't be a huge deal to see them go. Being able to view entire threads in an inbox instead of each reply counting as one message might be a nice compromise, though.<br /><br />2. Perhaps a quick reply function, then? Like, keep the reply button (so you can have access to the nicer textbox and see the user's raw message), but right below it is a similarly sized box with a shoutbox-like text input and send button?		</div>

			Let me get this straight: for the menu for inbox/outbox mashup would look something like this:<br /><a href="../images/upload_gallery/14600.html"><img src="../images/upload_gallery/14600_thumb.html" alt="thumb"></a><br /><br />And each thread would look like this:<br /><a href="../images/upload_gallery/14602.html"><img src="../images/upload_gallery/14602_thumb.html" alt="thumb"></a><br /><br />(my interpretation, so not everything is exactly as you might intend)		</div>

			1. Ex. I could send you a PM with the subject "pizza" where we talk about pizza toppings, then send another PM with the subject "bowling" where we talk about bowling. Currently, if I did that, both of these conversations would stay completely separate from each other.<br />If I'm understanding correctly, in your idea, separate conversations would be eliminated in favor of simply having one conversation with Tora-Kokoro, one with GuiedGui, etc.<br /><br />2. So basically private shoutboxes/chatrooms? Or *just* the idea of having message replying and the PM viewer combined?		</div>

			@banjo2<br /><br />First thing, I don't quite know what you mean by "removal of separate PM threads", but my guess is how each and every message is listed in either the inbox/outbox? I'm horrible at explaining...<br /><br />Second thing, the chatrooms are just like a type and go kinda thing? Whereas for private messaging, you have to go in and compose a whole message with a subject, and you have to have three or more characters in order to send it.<br /><br />Sorry if that doesn't make sense...		</div>

			Does your first suggestion imply the removal of separate PM threads?<br /><br />And, I disagree with the second one, because that would require autoscrolling or manually scrolling to the bottom of the page to see the newest message and then reply, both of which would be annoying.		</div>

			1. You know how Discord organizes private messages by user? Like, if I were to message you there, it creates a thread for our messages. That's how I want the messages here to be organized because currently, it's just every single message tossed onto a page, and it's hard to find messages.<br /><br />2. What about making it like how the chatrooms are organized? Instead of the messaging being like how Gmail works.<br /><br />3. For deletion, I don't know where things go on this site when you click that little red X. So I don't know how to answer that. But yeah; maybe a select and delete option where you can select that thread and it's deleted. But if someone deletes it from their end, it doesn't affect the messages on the other end. Or maybe, another option to archive it, and make a tab somewhere to find archived conversations.		</div>

			Star 1: I don't understand this point. How exactly would you get the list to be "organized by member", as you say? There's already the left/right dichotomy.<br /><br />Star 2: I disagree. Since the DSi automatically lands the user at the top, I don't see why they should sit through the page loading for a hot second before being able to respond to anything. Even if you replaced the box with something like Discord's text box, it would still have the same issue, albeit less loading.<br /><br />Yeah, no, DSis stop all JS from running once you pop open a textbox.<br /><br />Star 3: Do you mean delete an entire chain from existence? As to clear an entire conversation from the database so that nobody can see it anymore?		</div>
