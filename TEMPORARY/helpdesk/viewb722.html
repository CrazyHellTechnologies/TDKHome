			I have been a member on this site for 4+ long years. Back in the beginning, alt accounts were widespread and unrestricted. Completely unregulated. I had two: Gnilis-Al and Untitled. Shortly after, the admins found that they each had different opinions on alt accounts, in both existence and regulation. THis resulted in them laying out the regulations in blogs. The most recent one was this one by banjo2: <a href="../../external.html?link=https://dsipaint.com/blog/view.php?id=98245" rel="nofollow">/blog/view.php?id=98245</a><br /><br />The blog outlines the guidlines/rules for alt accounts and never says anything against them. I was active when this blog released and at that point, I actually deactivated my other alt and decided to just have one (Untitled) so no unecessary issues would arrise. I have always had those rules in mind and always have followed them, even leaving disclaimers that the account was indeed me, Siling-La. I also never used this account for no reason. I always used it for messing around with CSS skills and learning more. The blogs on that account were used to store notes for blog series such as Cerberus that I didn't want others to see (because one or two members I trust have Siling-La's password for various reasons), and sometimes even as a journal I could write in when I just had a 3ds. <br /><br />Never once stepping outside of the rules concerning alts, purposefully having it, and even making an effort to cause the least amount of issues with it, it is not only logical for me to be not only confused, but frustrated at its deactivation. I was never informed of any change of rules, nor was I informed it would be deleted so I could save anything from it. Unfairly an unprompted, my account was disabled. My account that I was going to access notes from today in writing Cerberus. My account that contains weeks worth of hours of code. My account that is not merely a useless alias or fake id, but a tool I use and puplically declare is me so that nothing is hidden.<br /><br />If this deactivation was due to the fact that it was styled to look like a "Hacker" account, I would have you know that in multiple places I left disclaimers saying that it was merely a joke. It was just a really fun vibe to create. I wasn't even asked to change that even though it has looked that way for nearly 3 years. In full knowledge of the SDKPaint Admin Team. <br /><br />My frustration with this action is hard to restrain. I have been nothing but a responsible member on this site for more years than most of this active community. I have abided by the rules to the letter and never once have stood in defiance of them. This is especially true when it comes to my alt. My own creations and information have been taken from me and I would like them back. I think that is reasonable. Even if you just activate it long enough for me to make copies of everything I had made. <br /><br />Please restore Untitled. I still have direct links to the profile even, if necessary.		</div>
