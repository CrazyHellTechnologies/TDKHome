						"Look out!" yelled a yound soldier as the main gate came crashing down and Fellranian forces flooded into Marmrun (the capital of Rubalia) and marched towards the palace, "We will not cry for help this time, this time we will send them crying for help and begging us to kill them, we will not give up what we worked hard for! To war!" shouted Lithia to her soldiers as they prepared for the enemies to breach the palace doors, meanwhile in Atron, "This will not stand, Lord Krel won't live to regret this!" yelled Arkin "Hey you know as well as I do that Lithia should handle this battle, we will get our chance soon enough." said Armen trying to calm Arkin down "Ok, ok, I will prepare my troops for the next battle." said Arkin, after he left Armen ran to the window and looked at Marmrun in the distance as smoke rose from the city she looked away as if trying to hide something "They cannot know my secret, it is none of their concern..." she said to herself, and paced back and forth worried.<br /><br />Just as the doors on the palace of Marmrun shattered a sense of dread hit the invading soldiers, and then Rubalian troops sprang up from nearly every direction and surrounded the invaders then Lithia walked up and said "Surrender and we will spare your army, if you do not we will destroy all of you!" the captain of the invaders then replied "We will not give up, you attacked us so you will pay!" and then suddenly a black shadow covered the room and all the soldiers fled in fear, "Who or what are you, show yourself!" shouted Lithia "It is me, my dear Lithia, Lord Krel." Krel said as he crept from the shadow "You will go down this time..." Lithia said as she drew her blades, "Nay it is you who will fall!" yelled Krel as he leapt forth with his sword drawn. They fought a ferocious fight, blade to blade, until Lithia was struck in the side and then kicked over "I...will not...give up, you will lose the long fight." said Lithia coughing up blood, "Oh is that so my dear slave girl, you will make a good servant to me..." said Krel but was interrupted when the wall crashed down as Arkin walked in, "If you touch even one hair on her you will beg the mountains to crush you..." spoke Arkin, angered "Arkin help me!" screamed Lithia "You will fall to my power!" yelled Krel, they drew their weapons and locked blades and Krel was injured badly but freed himself and impaled Arkin on a long pike, as Arkin lay there bleeding Lithia lost her breath in shock but then she stood up and threw her weapons aside, "Krel! You...will...die!" shouted Lithia as her eyes began to glow a bright firey light and her hands became as if they were fire, "What will you do to me, nothing that's what!" said Krel as he ran towards Lithia "Nice try, slug-filth!" said Lithia and then grabbed Krel by the throat, broke his ribs, and rolled him down the stairs to the palace, then Lithia fell to her hands and knees and crawled to Arkin's almost lifeless body "Arkin, Arkin, wake up...please I love you and I can't lose you!" Lithia said crying in a weak voice "Lithia...I...ack!" said Arkin and then yelled in pain, then he grabbed Lithia's Scarlet stone and pulled her close to him, "I will save you, Arkin..." she said as she focused her energy into the stone and healed him temporarily then brought him to Atron. <br /><br />As that was happening Armen was in Fellran meeting someone, "Please we must stop this fighting so we can be together." said Armen "I cannot make that choice and you know that." said a mysterious voice "So we must end this war somehow, but who's side will win?" said Armen "I do not care, we will discover that in the future...goodbye for now my love I pray that this war will end soon." said the man "Ok I must return to Atron, goodbye." said Armen, and then she left to Atron. While Lithia was speaking with the physician Arkin was dreaming of a different place, "Where am I ?" said Arkin "You are on Lunaria, the world above a world." said a friendly voice "Wait I know you, Groemin!?" Arkin said surprised "Well, yes and no, I am a form of Groemin you created when he died, so I was imprinted in your mind to help you learn the power of The Storm." explained the man "What do you mean help me learn The Storm?" asked Arkin "I shall explain in further detail, but now you must return to Undrael." said the man "Wait I...need to ask you something!" yelled Arkin "What is it Arkin?" asked Lithia "Oh nothing, just having a dream." said Arkin "Well I'm glad you are still alive, you shouldn't have came to help me...but I thank you anyway." said Lithia "I'm sorry for worrying you, I will be more carefu-" said Arkin until his chest spurted out blood and he fainted. "Help him! He is bleeding!" shouted Lithia "I shall do my best." said the physician calmly, and then Armen returned. <br /><br />When Arkin was mostly healed he dawned his armour and urged the others to do so as well, so they readied for another battle, this time in the lands of Fellran... <br /><br />To be continued...				</div>
