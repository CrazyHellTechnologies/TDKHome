						In the first year of the Second Era, there was mostly peace, with Saphaeria in the north-west, Rubalia in the north, Anderria in the east, and Fellran in the south-west. But one day there was three boastful young dragons, (even for dragons which are quite boastful in nature) who sought out recognition from the elder dragons, so to make a name for themselves they raided a small town in Fellran which was notorious for hating dragons but the youngest dragon was injured badly so they left. After that Lord Krel of Fellran called a meeting with King Arkin, Queen Lithia, and Queen Armen to discuss the situation about the dragons, but the meeting was delayed, Armen was sitting on the castle wall watching the world below with the majestic Lushu galloping threw the meadow singing their beautiful songs and the malevolent young Nixies swimming in the river and sitting on the shore side waiting for handsome young men to notice them and the sky filled with Phoenixs flying about burning bright red, as she watched Arkin came and tolded her it was time for the meeting, so she touched the wall warmed by the sun and stepped down to attend the meeting. <br /><br />When they arrived they saw Krel raging on about the situation, "It was all planned by you and your friends there, who are late!" yelled Krel in a crackling tone "There is no reason to shout Krel, let us discuss this with lower voices." said Lithia in a gentle soothing tone "Yes I agree, let us talk like the civilized people we are." spoke Arkin in a gruff tone "What is the problem here?" said Armen in a confident tone "It seems that a few dragons attacked Fellran, and Krel is blaming us." explained Lithia "Because you people orchestrated the entire thing, just to sabotage me and my people!" shouted Krel "Now now there is no need for that, we must investigate what happened." said Arkin "Krel is just trying to find an excuse to attack us!" yelled Armen "I think not, I think it is the other way around, Armen!" screeched Krel "Enough, we will see what happens next, if another attack occurs then we will start pointing fingers but for now just stop!" shouted Arkin "We will send our agents to inspect the scene, if we come up with anything then we will alert you Krel." said Lithia calmly "Fine! Goodbye and I hope you find the truth!" shouted Krel gruffly "Now let us attend the New Moon celebration." said Arkin "I'll see you there I have to do something important." said Armen nervously "Ok take your time, we will see you there." spoke Lithia, then Arkin and Lithia left but Armen stayed. <br /><br />Later that night Armen sat on the castle wall once again, looking out into the meadow. "I wish I had someone to be with, someone who I can talk to and understand." said Armen to herself "Well you still have me here..." said a voice "Who is it there!" said Armen "It's just me Arkin, I know being a ruler over a kingdom is hard but that doesn't mean the world is ending." said Arkin "I know, but I'm just...nevermind!" said Armen dismissively "I know your lonely, I will always be here Armen and I will always listen to what you have to say." said Arkin "Thank you Arkin." said Armin in a smooth quiet voice and hugged Arkin. Lithia looked from a window across the street and saw Arkin hugging Armen, but she only smiled and held the Scarlet Stone tightly. When they all showed up for the celebration everyone welcomed them and poured out drinks and served up food, Arkin and Armen sat next to Lithia, with the leaders from all the villages near them and they made a toast "To the freedom and peace of Undrael!" said the leader from Eskil, the village furthest away from Atron, "To the our just rulers, may King Arkin, Queen Armen, and Queen Lithia live long!" said the leader of Redendil, the village closest to Fellrun, "Amen!" shouted everyone. But just as everyone was celebrating a storm gathered up and started raining, so everyone said farewell and set off back to their homes, but when the leaders of Eskil and Redendil returned the storm became stronger and more powerful, then a bright beam hit Eskil and Redendil and all of the inhabitants felt a great power surge threw them, and then the people of Eskil felt bark and tree limbs grow around them, and the people of Redendil felt hard skin form around them and both villages had their people change, the people of Redendil became insect-like with mandables and antennae, but the people of Eskil had become tree-like with hard bark and wood as there skin and bones, and so The Storm of Peoples had happened. <br /><br />But in the lands of Fellran trouble was brewing, Lord Krel had convinced all the wandering tribes and villagers around that the others planned to attack them but as soon as he finished a dark shadow flew past, they all scattered and the a large blast shot forth from the shadow and burned up the storehouse and the shadow grabbed up two people and left, but Krel said it was all Queen Lithias doing so they gathered up a great force and marched to Rubalia. To be continued.				</div>
